# NoStorageRestrict

Removes the restriction when selecting folders (Downloads/Android) through the file manager on Android 11 and higher

# Disclaimer

Due to the nature of the Magisk version (replacing APKs) it may not work and result in crashes for some users, in those cases the Xposed version is more recommended.

For the Xposed version look here:
